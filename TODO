turtle.py:
    * find alternative to pySVG
      (confusing licence terms for pySVG. http://codeboje.de/pysvg/ says
      BSD-new, while the "complete source tree" downlowload has two licences;
      the GPLv3 and a separate licence for "any redistribution for which you
      demand money" and "any usage of pySVG in a company". Eh, what?)

    * create turtle with csound or similar sound library

lsystem.py:
    * create a stochastic generator
